Web Visualization Dashboard

I have created individual pages for each plot and a means by which to navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page, a page where there is a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where the data used to build them can be viewed.

The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:
  - A landing page
  - Four visualization pages
  - A comparisons page
  - A data page

There is also a navigation menu at the top of every page that contains:
  - the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page
  - Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page
  - Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page
  - Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section (notice the background color change)
